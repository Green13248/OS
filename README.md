# OS

This is an OS developed by me
important for building:

nasm -f bin "C:\User\Desktop\Operating\nameSource.txt" -o "C:\User\Desktop\nameCompiled.ISO" to build into an ISO

gcc -c File.c -o File.o to make a c into object

g++ -cpp File.cpp -o File.o to make a cpp into an object

gcc File1.o File2.o -o File3 to link your object files

nasm "C:\Users\Desktop\Source.asm" -f elf -o "C:\Users\Desktop\Source.o" to make asm into an object file

"C:\Program Files\qemu\qemu-system-x86_64.exe" "C:\User\Desktop\nameCompiled.ISO" to run on Qemu
