# OS

This is an OS developed by me

Maybe someday it will do these things:

  Run in 32 bit mode
  
  Run in 64 bit mode
  
  Have some form of window manager/windowing system (Might be x11 or other)
  
  Have some form of language compiler (C, C++, Perl)
  
  Run some form of web/internet browser
  
  Be able to open things like bitmaps and png or jpegs
  
  Be not all asm
